# stego-mirror-transformer
Implementation of Text Steganography using two differently conditioned language models. Our protocol supports different kind of models such as :

* gpt2: ***small, medium, large, xl***
* bert
* roberta

## Usage

You can play with our protocol through the notebook ```DemoStego.ipynb```. You can either run it on your local machine if you have enough computational power, or use the colabs version for a quick demo : **link**.

### Experiments in the local machine:

First, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. After that :
```jupyter-notebook``` and select the ```DemoStego.ipynb``` notebook.


### Run on Google Colabs
